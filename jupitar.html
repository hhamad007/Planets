      Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, known for its massive size and distinctive bands of clouds. It is a gas giant primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with a strong magnetic field and numerous moons, including the four large Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Jupiter's Great Red Spot is a giant storm that has been raging for centuries. The planet plays a crucial role in shaping the dynamics of the solar system due to its immense gravitationalqq influence.
