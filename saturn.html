        Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of
        hydrogen and helium. Saturn is not the only planet to have rings, but
        none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. Saturn also has
        dozens of moons. From the jets of water that spray from Saturn's moon
        Enceladus to the methane lakes on smoggy Titan, the Saturn system is a
        rich source of scientific discovery and still holds many mysteries.
